<div id="outline-container-orgf888eca" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf888eca"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> What is cross compilation?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
First, compilation refers to converting human-readable source code
into computer-readable object code. Usually the computer you are
building the code <i>for</i> is the same as the computer you are running
<i>on</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. In cross compilation, however, that is not the case. We can
build code for any computer that our compiler supports!
</p>

<p>
Cross-compilation is not a new idea at all. GCC and Autoconf are
ancient tools that we use internally in Nixpkgs. But, getting those
ideas to work well with Nix’s functional dependency model has taken
years and years of work from the Nix community. We are finally to the
point where an end user can easily start cross compiling things
themselves.

<h2 id="org3dec937"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Unstable channel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
/If you do not have Nix installed, you can install it available at
<a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">NixOS.org</a>. The rest of the guide will assume that Nix is already
installed./
</p>

<p>
Much work has gone into bringing cross compilation support to Nixpkgs.
While Nixpkgs has had some support for cross compiling for awhile,
recent changes have made cross compilation much easier and more
elegant. These changes will be required for this guide. We plan to
have a stable version of this ready for 18.09. Before that though, you
will need to use the unstable channel. Things can be built with the
unstable channel fairly easily with Nix 2.0. For instance, to build
the hello program,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable hello
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The rest of the guide will use nixos-unstable as the channel. However,
once 18.09 is released, you should be able to also use the stable
channel.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
One of the important principles of cross compilation in Nixpkgs is
handling native and cross compilation identically. This means that it
should be possible to cross-compile any package in Nixpkgs with little
to no modification at all. If your derivation specifies its
dependencies correctly, Nix/Nixpkgs can figure out how to build it.
</p>

<p>
So now it’s time to show what we can do with Nixpkgs cross compilation
framework<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. I’ve compiled a short list of cross package sets
along with their corresponding attribute names.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Raspberry Pi (pkgsCross.raspberryPi)</li>
<li><code>x86_64</code> Musl (pkgsCross.musl64)</li>
<li>Android (pkgsCross.aarch64-android-prebuilt)</li>
<li>iPhone (pkgsCross.iphone64)</li>
<li>Windows (pkgsCross.mingwW64)</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, if you are familiar with Nixpkgs, you would know that if you
wanted to build Emacs for your native computer you can just run,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable pkgs.emacs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Likewise, if you wanted to build Emacs for a Raspberry Pi, you can
just run,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable pkgsCross.raspberryPi.emacs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The built package will be in the same ARM machine code used by the
Raspbery Pi. The important thing to notice here is that we have the
power to build in any package in Nixpkgs for any of the platforms
listed above. Of course, many of these will have issues due to not
being portable, but with time we can make both Nixpkgs &amp; the free
software world better at handling cross compilation. Any of the
software listed in ‘nix search’ should be possible to cross compile
through the pkgsCross attribute.
</p>

<p>
Some more examples of things that I have worked on,
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Windows
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable pkgsCross.mingw32.hello
$ nix run -f channel:nixos-unstable wine -c ./result/bin/hello.exe
Hello, world!
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Android
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
      pkgsCross.aarch64-android-prebuilt.curl
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
iPhone<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
      pkgsCross.iphone64.haskell.packages.jq
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<p>
Notice that the pkgsCross attribute is just sugar to a more powerful &amp;
composable interface to Nixpkgs. This can be specified from the
command line with,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
      --arg crossSystem <span class="org-string">'{ config = "&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;vendor&gt;-&lt;kernel&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;"; }'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For instance you may want to cross-compile Firefox for ARM64 Linux.
This is as easy as<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
      --arg crossSystem <span class="org-string">'{ config = "arm64-unknown-linux-gnu"; }'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can be much more specific with what you want through crossSystem.
Many more combinations are possible, but they all revolve around that
four-part string config listed. It corresponds to
<code>&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;vendor&gt;-&lt;kernel&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;</code> and is commonly called the
LLVM triple<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>. The LLVM triple has become the standard way to
specify systems accross many free software toolchains including GCC,
Binutils, Clang, libffi, etc. There is more information that can be
specified in <code>crossSystem</code> &amp; <code>localSystem</code> within Nixpkgs but this is
not covered here as they are heavily dependent on the specific
toolchain being used.

<h2 id="org7407976"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> When things break</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
While the fundamentals of cross compiling in Nixpkgs are very good,
individual packages will sometimes be broken. This is sometime because
the package definition in Nixpkgs is incorrect. There are some common
mistakes that occur that I want to cover here. First, the difference
between ‘build-time’ vs ‘runtime’ dependencies<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>build-time dependencies: tools that will be run on the computer
doing the cross compiling</li>
<li>runtime dependencies: libraries and tools that will run on the
computer we are targeting.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In Nixpkgs, build-time dependencies should be put in
<code>nativeBuildInputs</code>. Runtime dependencies should be put in
<code>buildInputs</code>. Currently, this distinction has no effect on native
compilation but it is crucial for correct cross-compilation. There are
proposals to Nixpkgs to enforce the use of <code>buildInputs</code> as
<code>nativeBuildInputs</code> even on native builds but this is yet to be agreed
on<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes your package will pull in a dependency indirectly so that
dependency is not listed in <code>buildInputs</code> or <code>nativeBuildInputs</code>. This
breaks the package splicing that goes on behind the scenes to make
pick up the package set to get each package. To fix it, you will have
to splice the package yourself. This is fairly straightforward. For
examples, let’s say that your package depends on the <code>pkgs.git</code> git
executable to be available through the <code>GIT_CMD</code> variable, which means
it is not listed in <code>nativeBuildInputs</code>. In this case, you should
instead refer to <code>git</code> as <code>pkgs.buildPackages.git</code>. This will pick up
the build package set instead of the target package set.
</p>

<p>
There are a few more things that can go wrong within Nixpkgs. If you
need to conditionally do something only when cross compiling (say a
configure flag like <code>--enable-cross-compilation</code>), you should use
<code>stdenv.hostPlatform != stdenv.buildPlatform</code>. If you want to check,
for instance, that the platform you are building for is a Windows
computer, just use <code>stdenv.hostPlatform.isWindows</code>, in the same way
that you can also check for Linux with <code>stdenv.hostPlatform.isLinux</code>.
These cases are often necessary, but remember they should only be used
when absolutely needed. The more code we share between platforms, the
more code is tested.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes packages are just not written in a cross-friendly way. This
will usually happen just because the software author has not thought
of how to handle cross compilation<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>. We want to work with
software authors to make this process easier &amp; contribute to the
portability of free software. This takes time but we are definitely
making progress. Contributions are always encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/">the Nixpkgs
repo</a>.

<p>
GNU Automake also has a section on build vs. host vs. target. This
will help clarify some of the naming conventions in Nixpkgs:
