<p>
btilly on Hacker News had <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20032255">an insightful observation</a> on how projects
deal with dependencies. There are two very different approaches to
dependency management.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The first version is to lock down every dependency as tightly as you
can to avoid accidentally breaking something. Which inevitably leads
down the road to everything being locked to something archaic that
can't be upgraded easily, and is incompatible with everything else.
But with no idea what will break, or how to upgrade. I currently work
at a company that went down that path and is now suffering for it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This first version is commonly done through lock files which pin to
specific versions or hashes. But, there is no clear idea how to
incorporate dependencies updates.

The second version is upgrade early, upgrade often. This will
occasionally lead to problems, but they tend to be temporary and
easily fixed. And in the long run, your system will age better. Google
is an excellent example of a company that does this.

<p>
This second version is a more forward thinking approach. The goal is
to follow the latest available version. Obviously, you cannot always
be perfectly up-to-date, but if you try your best you can get pretty
close. This is very similar to Arch Linux’s rolling release model.
</p>

<p>
But, there is a 3rd way that combines the advantages of both
approaches. Instead of pinning to dependencies, you pin to an entire
set of dependencies. This gives you . oYou are guaranteed stability and that
dependencies work together while you are pinned to one set. Non
breaking changes like security fixes can still happen but major
updates don’t. This is less reproducible than locking everything, but
we get to reuse fixes among projects and backport them to the shared
set. Updating your dependencies is just moving to a new package set.
This approach is utilized by NixOS and Stack, but AFAICT no where
else.
