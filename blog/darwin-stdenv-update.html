<p>
Over the past couple of months, I have been working on updating the
macOS stdenv in Nixpkgs. This has significant impact on users of
Nix/Nixpkgs on macOS. So, I want to explain what’s being updated, what
the benefits are, and how we can minimize breakages.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbb04dec" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbb04dec"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> macOS/Darwin stdenv changes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
First, to summarize the changes that impact stdenv and the Darwin
infrastructure. The PR is available at <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/56744">NixOS/nixpkgs PR #56744</a>. This
update has been in the works for the last few months, and is currently
in the staging-next branch, waiting to be merged in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/60491">NixOS/nixpkgs PR
#60491</a>. It should land on master and nixpkgs-unstable in the next few
days. The main highlights are —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change default LLVM toolchain from 5 to 7. LLVM 5 stdenv is still
available through <code>llvmPackages_5.stdenv</code> attribute path.</li>
<li>Upgrade Apple SDK from 10.10 to 10.12.</li>
<li>Update libSystem symbols from 10.10 (XNU 3789.1.32) to 10.12 (XNU
3789.1.32).</li>
<li>Removed old patches to support old stdenv in Qt 5 and elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These macOS SDK upgrades are equivalent to setting
<code>-mmacosx-version-min</code> to 10.12 in XCode. As a result, we will break
compatibility with macOS before 10.12.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org12667fa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org12667fa"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Why do we need to set a minimum macOS version?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Without knowing internals of Nixpkgs, it might not be clear why we
need to set a minimum macOS version. For instance with Linux, we are
able to support any Linux kernel in Nixpkgs without any problem. The
answer to this requires some understanding of how the kernel and
userspace function.
</p>

<p>
Nixpkgs is able to support multiple Linux kernels because we can use
multiple Libc’s at one time. For any executable, a Nix closure will
include both its own Libc and the dynamic linker in its closure. This
works in Linux where multiple Libc’s can be used, but not on macOS
where only one Libc is available.
</p>

<p>
In short, Linux and macOS deal with compatibility between built
binaries in different ways. They represent two opposite ends in how
Unix-like kernels maintain compatibility with their userspace binaries.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1208a19" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1208a19"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Linux syscall compatibility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The kernel is responsible for managing core operating system functions
such as start-up, memory management, device abstractions, and process
isolation. For it to function, the kernel needs to interact with the
rest of the operating system which is collectively referred to as
“userspace”. Executables in userspace use “syscalls” to tell the
kernel what to do. These syscalls are very low-level and usually not
called directly by a process. Instead, an abstraction layer is
provided by the standard C library, or Libc.
</p>

<p>
Linux is unique among operating systems due to the fact that the
Kernel and Libc are developed independently. Linux is maintained by
creator Linus Torvalds and a community of contributors. Glibc, the
most popular Libc for Linux, is maintained by the GNU project. As a
result, Linux has a strong separation between Syscalls and Libc.
</p>

<p>
Linux does not tie itself to any specific Libc. Even though Glibc is
used in almost all distros, many alternatives are available. For
instance, Musl provides a more lightweight version of Glibc, while
Bionic is the Libc used in the Android operating system. In addition,
multiple versions of each of these Libc’s can be used on any one
kernel, even at the same time. This can become very common when using
multiple Nixpkgs versions at one time.
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, Linux provides a stable list of syscalls that it
has maintained across many versions. This is specified for i386 at
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl">arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl</a> in the kernel tree. The
syscalls specified here are the interface through which the Libc
communicates with the kernel. As a result, applications built in 1992
can run on a modern kernel, provided it comes with copies of all its
libraries<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd9b5855" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd9b5855"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> macOS Libc compatibility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The macOS Libc is called libSystem. It is available on all macOS
systems at <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code>. This library is the main
interface that binary compatibility is maintained in macOS. Unlike
Linux, macOS maintains a stable interface in libSystem that all
executables are expected to link to. This interface is guaranteed by
Apple to be stable between versions.
</p>

<p>
In Nixpkgs, we maintain this compatibility through a list of symbols
that are exported by libSystem. This is a simple text list and is
available for viewing at
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/os-specific/darwin/apple-source-releases/Libsystem/system_c_symbols">NixOS/nixpkgs/pkgs/os-specific/darwin/apple-source-releases/Libsystem/system_c_symbols</a>.
The symbol list is created by listing symbols (<code>nm</code>) on the minimum
macOS version that we support (for my PR, 10.12). We do some linking
tricks to ensure that everything that we build in Nixpkgs only
contains those symbols. This means that we can reproducibly build on
newer versions of macOS, while maintaining compatibility with older
macOS versions. Unfortunately, newer symbols introduced in later
versions cannot be used even on systems that have those symbols.
</p>

<p>
A side effect of macOS design, is that fully static executables are
not supported in macOS as they are on Linux. Without a stable syscall
interface, there is nothing to provide compatibility between versions.
As a result, Apple does not support this type of linking<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
There is no mandated reason why we need to use libSystem directly. In
fact, some languages like Go have attempted to instead use the syscall
interface directly. There is no reason why this couldn’t work,
however, upgrades between versions will almost certainly break
binaries. Go eventually <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17490">abandoned this scheme in time for Go 1.12</a>
(proposed by Nixpkgs macOS contributor copumpkin!)

<h3 id="orgc0b15d1"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Others</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Some other examples may be useful. They mostly fall on one side or the
other of the Syscall / Libc divide —
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>FreeBSD - breaks syscall compatibility between major releases,
should use Libc for longterm binary compatibility.</li>
<li>OpenBSD - similarly, changes syscall interface, perhaps even more
often than FreeBSD<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li>NetBSD - apparently has maintained syscall compatibility
since 1992. <sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Windows, Solaris, Fuchsia - I cannot find any information on these
and how they handle binary compatibility.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7894f87" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7894f87"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> LLVM triple</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
As a side note, this difference can be clearly seen in how we specify
target systems. The LLVM triple is a 3 or 4-part string specifying
what we want to build for. The parts of the triple correspond to:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">&lt;cpu&gt;-&lt;vendor&gt;-&lt;kernel&gt;-&lt;abi&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>&lt;cpu&gt;</code> — the CPU architecture that we are building for. Examples
include <code>x86_64</code>, <code>aarch64</code>, <code>armv7l</code>, etc.</li>
<li><code>&lt;vendor&gt;</code> — an arbitrary string specifying the vendor for the
toolchain. In Nixpkgs, this should always be <code>unknown</code>.</li>
<li><code>&lt;kernel&gt;</code> — the kernel to build for (<code>linux</code>).</li>
<li><code>&lt;abi&gt;</code> — the kernel ABI to use. On Linux, this corresponds to the
Libc we are using (<code>gnu</code> for Glibc, <code>musl</code> for Musl, <code>android</code> for
Bionic).</li>
</ul>

<p>
When building for Linux, we can build for any version of Linux at one
time. No version information is required. In addition, we must specify
what “ABI” we want to use. In Nix, this is not very important because
the Libc is provided by the closure. In fact, Nix has its own version
of the LLVM triple called a Nix system tuple that omits the <code>&lt;abi&gt;</code>
portion altogether! It corresponds to <code>&lt;cpu&gt;-&lt;kernel&gt;</code> from the LLVM
triple.
</p>

<p>
In comparison, when building for BSDs, we must specify which
version of the kernel we are building for. In addition, we leave off
the <code>&lt;abi&gt;</code> portion, because there is only one Libc available for
these platforms. They are even included in the same tree as the
kernel. Examples of BSD triples include,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>aarch64-apple-darwin16.0.0</code></li>
<li><code>x86_64-unknown-freebsd12.0</code></li>
<li><code>i386-unknown-openbsd5.8</code></li>
<li><code>armv7l-unknown-netbsd7.99</code></li>
</ul>

Looking through the old versions, I’ve compiled a list of what I think
are the corresponding macOS versions for each Nixpkgs release. As you
can see, we try to support at least 3 previous macOS releases. This
also happens to be about what Apple supports through security
updates<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>.

<p>
We know that some users are stuck on older versions of macOS due to
reasons outside of their control. As a result, we will try to support
the 19.03 branch for a little bit longer than is usually done. If your
organization uses 10.11, it might be a good idea to update to a newer
version along with your update to Nixpkgs 19.09.

My main goal has been to show better how Nixpkgs and macOS system
interact. I got a little bit sidetracked exploring differences in
binary compatibility between different operating systems. But, this
should help users to better understand the differences in how macOS
and Linux works in relation to Nixpkgs.
