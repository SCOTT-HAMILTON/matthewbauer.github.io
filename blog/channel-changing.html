<p>
One of the many underappreciated feature of Nix is its ability to
travel back in time. Functional dependencies mean that you can easily
pull in old releases of NixOS and Nixpkgs without changing your
environment at all! It’s surprisingly easy with Nix 2.0 and its
support for Import From Derivation.
</p>

<p>
First, I will provide some code to get us started. This Nix script is
what I use as my “channel changer”. It bootstraps the use of old
channels. In Nix-world, channels are just what we call the CI-tested
branch of NixOS/Nixpkgs<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. The NixOS maintainers have been making
releases consistently since 2013, so there is a lot of interesting
history.

Here is my script that I will refer to later on in the post
as “channels.nix” (be sure to try it out yourself!)

<p>
As you can see from the script there have been 9 releases in total. We
use a different letter of the alphabet for each release, starting with
A for Aardvark and we are not up to I for Impala<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. New releases
happen every 6 months starting with Aardvark which was released in
December 2013. The releases are versioned as <code>YY.MM</code> which is common
practice for Linux distros.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd508459" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd508459"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> ‘nix run’ magic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In my Nix script, I have created an “attribute” for each version that
has been released. With Nix 2.0, it is very easy to run packages from
them. Here is the command to run <code>hello</code> world from Hummingbird.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix hummingbird.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Hello, world!

</pre>

<p>
This has run the <code>hello</code> executable from the hummingbird release. Since
you are most likely not running Hummingbird, it may take a while to
run the first time. However, once Nix has downloaded the needed files
future execution will be instantaneous. The package is complete
self-contained! For now, we will just use Impala (18.03) so that
things go a little faster.
</p>

<p>
There are lots of packages in Nixpkgs so we don’t have to restrict
ourselves to just hello. Let’s try out cowsay first.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix impala.cowsay -c cowsay hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
 _______
&lt; hello &gt;
 -------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

</pre>

<p>
There are many, many more of these commands. I’ve included a few below
for you to try out on your own.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<h2 id="orga56a566"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> The macOS+Nix odyssey</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The fact that Nix works so well on macOS is a miracle in its own
right. Apple has a proprietary ABI but Nix is intended to be used with
free software. To get around this, many hacks are necessary including
taking Apple’s standard C library<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. Anyway, I was interested in how
well the binaries produced by Nixpkgs hold up on my MacBook. For
reference, here are the versions of macOS available when each release
happened. Those familiar with macOS internals will remember some
significant differences between these versions.
</p>

</table>

<p>
So, my MacBook is running the latest macOS 10.13. Naturally we can
test that Impala &amp; Hummingbird will work correctly. <code>hello</code> is a good
tester, of course, not comprehensive.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix impala.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Hello, world!

</pre>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix hummingbird.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Hello, world!

</pre>

<p>
But now let’s test Gorilla. It was released when macOS Sierra was
still around but the ABI should be compatible.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix gorilla.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/system/libsystem_coretls.dylib
 Referenced from: /nix/store/v7i520r9c2p8z6vk26n53hfrxgqn8cl9-Libsystem-osx-10.11.6/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
 Reason: image not found
sh: line 1: 23628 Abort trap: 6           nix run -f channels.nix gorilla.hello -c hello

</pre>

<p>
Oh no!
</p>

<p>
We can see that libSystem 10.11 has been downloaded for us<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>.
However, libSystem is referring to an image that isn’t on our machine.
<code>libsystem_coretls.dylib</code> must have existed in 10.11 macOS but been
removed since then<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
At this point, it may look like Nixpkgs will be broken going
backwards. But, I want to try Flounder just to see what happens.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix flounder.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Hello, world!

</pre>

<p>
Amazingly, it worked! I am still not sure what the differences are,
but it seems that the older executable is still available. Let’s try
out Emu to see what happens there.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix emu.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
builder for '/nix/store/s41jnb4kmxxbwj40c5l88k9ma0mwfy0b-hello-2.10.drv' failed due to signal 4 (Illegal instruction: 4)
error: build of '/nix/store/s41jnb4kmxxbwj40c5l88k9ma0mwfy0b-hello-2.10.drv' failed

</pre>

<p>
Wow! Again we hit an issue. This is the infamouse <code>Illegal
instruction: 4</code> bug that is frequently hit in Nixpkgs<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>. It occurs
when an executable uses instructions that have been blocked by the XNU
kernel. This is usually because they are considered insecure and will
require a patche to fix. We no longer support Emu, so this is probably
the end of the line. Let’s try Dingo out just to be sure though.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix dingo.hello -c hello

<p>
This is a curious error because it is very different from the previous
one. Back here we are still using Clang and it looks like
bootstrapping is failing. I was not using Nix at this time (late
2015), so I will have to defer to someone who remembers that time
better. Let’s keep going.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
I’ve grouped them together because they have the same output. It
appears that <code>hello</code> was not available back then! I’m not sure what is
going on. Again, I will defer to someone else to explain why this
happens. But, I know for a fact that GNU Hello is one of the first
packages to be packaged in the Nix language<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>.

I wanted to also look at what happens on Linux when you go back
through channels. I don’t have time currently so I am just including
what I have. Anyway, if you are able to report back what happens on
Linux when running these old channels, it would certainly be
interesting.
</p>

<p>
My main goal was to just share some useful things in Nix that I don’t
think many people outside of the core Nix community know about.
Documentation has gotten better recently but lots of times people like
to just read blog posts like this. Hopefully you got a feel for what
can be done in Nix.
