<h2 id="org6e664e2"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> My subjective ranking of build systems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Very few of us are happy with our choices of build systems. There
are a lot out there and none feel quite right to many people. I
wanted to offer my personal opinions on build systems. Every build
system is “bad” in its own way. But some are much worse than
others.
</p>

<p>
As a maintainer for Nixpkgs, we have to deal with . I’ve avoided
build systems that are language-specific. Those build systems are
usually the only choice for your language, so ranking them will
inevitably include opinions on the language itself. So, I’ve
included in this list only language neutral build systems. In
addition, I’ve filtered out any build systems that are not included
in Nixpkgs. This perspective is going to prioritize features that
make your project easiest to package in cross-platform ways. It’s
very subjective, so I only speak for myself here.
</p>

<p>
I separate two kinds of software used for packages. One is the
“meta” build system that provides an abstract interface to create
build rules. The other is the build runner that will run the rules.
Most meta build systems support targeting multiple backends.

<h3 id="orgc7cae77"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> What makes a good build system?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Some criteria I have for these build systems.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good defaults builtin. By default, packages should support
specifying “prefix” and “destination directory”.</li>
<li>Works with widely available software. Being able to generate
Makefiles is a big bonus. Everyone has access to make - not
everyone has Ninja. This is often needed for bootstrapping.</li>
<li>Supports cross compilation concepts. A good separation between
buildtime and runtime is a must have! In addition you should be
able to set build, host, and target from the command line. This
makes things much easier for packaging and bootstrapping.</li>
<li>Detection of dependencies reuses existing solutions. Pkgconfig
provides an easy way to detect absolute directories. No need to
reinvent the wheel here.</li>
<li>The less dependencies the better! Requiring a Java or Python
runtime means it takes longer to rebuild the world. They
introduce bottlenecks where every package needs to wait for these
runtimes to be built before we can start running things in
parallel.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org0908b83"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Ranking of meta build systems from bad to worse</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>GNU Autotools (Automake &amp; autoconf)</li>
<li>Meson</li>
<li>CMake</li>
<li>gyp</li>
<li>qmake</li>
<li>imake</li>
<li>premake</li>
</ol>

<p>
GNU Autotools comes in at the top. It has the best support for
cross compilation of any meta build system. It has been around for
a while and means that the classic “./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
install” work. Because the configure script is just a simple bash
script, packages don’t have to depend directly on GNU Autotools at
build time. This is a big plus in bootstrapping software. I think
Meson has made a lot of progress in improving its cross
compilation support. It’s not quite there in my opinion, as it
requires you to create cross tool files instead of using command
line arguments.

<div id="outline-container-org67f64c2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org67f64c2"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Ranking of build runners from bad to worse</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>GNU Make</li>
<li>Ninja</li>
<li>Bazel</li>
<li>boost.build</li>
<li>SCons</li>
</ol>

<p>
GNU Make is still the top choice in my personal opinion. It has
been around for a while, but Makefiles are widely understood and
GNU Make is included everywhere. In addition, the Makefile build
rule format is easy to parallelize. Ninja still requires Python to
build itself. This adds to the Nixpkgs bottleneck because Python
is not included in the bootstrap tools. While there are some
speedups in Ninja, they don’t appear to be significant enough to
be worth switching at this time. At the same time, Ninja is still
a perfectly good choice if you value performance over legacy
support.

<h3 id="org79b73bf"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
In Nixpkgs, we have made an attempt to support whatever build
system you are using. But, some are definitely better than others.
</p>

<p>
My main goal here is to try to get software authors to think more
critically about what build system they are using. In my opinion,
it is better to use well known software over more obscure systems.
These shouldn’t be taken as a universal truth. Everyone has their
own wants and needs. But, if your build system comes in at the
bottom of this list, you might want to consider switching to
something else!
